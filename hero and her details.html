    <p>
        Depp was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky,[9][10][11] the youngest of four
        children of waitress Betty Sue Depp (née Wells; later Palmer)[12] and civil engineer John
        Christopher Depp.[13][14] Depp's family moved frequently during his childhood, eventually 
        settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970.[15] His parents divorced in 1978 when he was 15,[15]
        [16] and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called "an inspiration".[17]
        Depp's mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands.[15] 
        
        [15] In 1980, Depp began playing in a band called The Kids.
       After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record
       deal, changing its name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd 
       jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married makeup artist Lori Anne Allison,[10]
       the sister of his band's bassist and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984,
       and Depp began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels.[19] He co-wrote their song "Mary", which 
       appeared on their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's Blues.[20] Depp and Allison divorced in 1985.
       Depp is of primarily English descent, with some French, German, Irish and African American ancestry. 
       Elizabeth Key Grinstead, one of the first African Americans in the North American colonies to sue for 
       her freedom and win, is an eighth great-grandmother.[22] His surname comes from a French Huguenot 
       immigrant, Pierre Dieppe, who settled in Virginia around 1700. In interviews in 2002 and 2011, Depp 
       claimed to have Native American ancestry, "I guess I have some Native American somewhere down the line. 
       My great-grandmother was quite a bit of Native American. She grew up Cherokee or maybe Creek Indian. 
       Makes sense in terms of coming from Kentucky, which is rife with Cherokee and Creek Indian".[23]
       Depp's claims came under scrutiny when Indian Country Today wrote that Depp had never inquired about 
       his heritage or been recognized as a member of the Cherokee Nation.[24] This led to criticism of Deep, 
       from the Native American community, as Depp has no documented Native ancestry,[24] and Native community 
       leaders consider him "a non-Indian"[24][25] and a pretendian.[26][27][28] Depp's choice to portray Tonto,
        a Native American character, in The Lone Ranger was criticized,[24][25] along with his choice to name his
        rock band "Tonto's Giant Nuts".[29][30][31][32] During the promotion for The Lone Ranger, Depp was formally 
        adopted as an honorary son by LaDonna Harris, a member of the Comanche Nation, making him an honorary member 
        of her family but not a member of any tribe

        He dropped out of Miramar High School at 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to 
        school two weeks later, but the principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician.[15] In 1980, 
        Depp began playing in a band called The Kids.

          (1986), before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street (1987–1990).

          Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), and Alice in Wonderland (2010).
          Depp gained worldwide stardom for his role as Captain Jack Sparrow in the swashbuckler film series Pirates 
          of the Caribbean (2003–2017). He also gained acclaim for starring in Chocolat (2000), and Finding Neverland 
          (2004). Other films he has starred in include From Hell (2001), Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003), Secret 
          Window (2004), Public Enemies (2009), The Tourist (2010), The Lone Ranger (2013), Into the Woods (2014), 
          Black Mass (2015), and Murder on the Orient Express (2017). He portrayed Gellert Grindelwald in 
          the Wizarding World films Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) and Fantastic Beasts: 
          The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018). His voice acting work includes Corpse Bride (2005), Rango (2011), 
          and Sherlock Gnomes (2018).Depp received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999.[5] He was named 
          People's Sexiest Man Alive twice in 2003 and in 2009.[6] During the 2010s, Depp began producing films 
          through his company Infinitum Nihil. He also formed the rock supergroup Hollywood Vampires with Alice 
          Cooper and Joe Perry. Between 1998 and 2012, Depp was in a relationship with the French singer Vanessa 
          Paradis, with whom he had two children, including the actress Lily-Rose Depp. From 2015 to 2017, Depp 
          was married to the actress Amber Heard. Their divorce drew media attention, as both alleged abuse 
          against each other and engaged in two highly publicized defamation cases: the Depp v. NGN and the Depp 
          v. Heard trials.
